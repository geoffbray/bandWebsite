            <p> Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States 
                in the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing into a range of different styles in the mid-1960s and later, 
                particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom.[1][page needed] It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s 
                rock and roll, a style that drew directly from the black musical genres of blues, rhythm and blues, and from 
                country music. Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, 
                and incorporated influences from jazz, classical, and other musical styles. For instrumentation, rock has 
                centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass, drums, and one or more 
                singers. Usually, rock is song-based music with a 4-4 time signature using a verse–chorus form, 
                but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but 
                also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political.

                    Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music[3][4] that developed in the late 1960s and 
                    early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States.[5] With roots in blues rock, 
                    psychedelic rock, and acid rock,[6] heavy metal bands developed a thick, massive sound, characterized 
                    by distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and loudness. The lyrics and performances are 
                    sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  In 1968, three of the genre's most famous 
                    pioneers, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple, were founded.[7] Though they came to attract 
                    wide audiences, they were often derided by critics. Several American bands modified heavy metal into 
                    more accessible forms during the 1970s: the raw, sleazy sound and shock rock of Alice Cooper and Kiss; 
                    the blues-rooted rock of Aerosmith; and the flashy guitar leads and wild party rock of Van Halen.[8] 
                    During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues 
                    influence,[9][10] while Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. 
                    Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon 
                    followed in a similar vein. By the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as "metalheads" or 
                    "headbangers".  During the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as Bon Jovi and Mötley Crüe. Underground 
                    scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands 
                    such as Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres such as death metal and 
                    black metal remain subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s, popular styles have expanded the definition 
                    of the genre. These include groove metal and nu metal, the latter of which often incorporates elements of
                    grunge and hip hop.
